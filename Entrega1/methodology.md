# Project Methodology

## Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive methodology employed in developing our human action recognition system. Our approach adapts the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework to the specific requirements of real-time human action recognition, incorporating modern computer vision techniques and machine learning practices. The methodology encompasses everything from initial data collection to model deployment, with particular attention to the unique challenges of real-time processing and human movement analysis.

## Adapted CRISP-DM Framework

### 1. Business Understanding

Our initial phase focused on defining clear objectives for the action recognition system. Through careful analysis of requirements, we identified five key actions to recognize: walking towards the camera, walking away, turning, sitting down, and standing up. These actions were selected based on their fundamental nature in human movement and their potential applications in movement analysis systems.

The project requirements were structured around three key pillars:
- Real-time processing capabilities
- Accurate action classification
- Robust postural analysis

### 2. Data Understanding and Collection

#### Data Collection Infrastructure

We developed a sophisticated data collection system (implemented in `VideoDataCollector` class) with the following key features:

- Real-time video capture using OpenCV
- Automated file naming and organization
- Support for multiple subjects
- Quality control mechanisms during recording
- Structured data storage hierarchy

The system implements robust error handling and provides real-time feedback during recording sessions, ensuring data quality and consistency.

#### Recording Protocol

A standardized recording protocol was established to ensure data quality:
- Adequate lighting conditions
- Sufficient space for natural movement
- Multiple angles and variations of each action
- Consistent frame rate (30 FPS)
- Clear field of view for full body capture

### 3. Data Preparation

#### Feature Engineering Pipeline

Our feature engineering process, implemented in `ActionVideoProcessor`, consists of several sophisticated stages:

1. **Pose Estimation**
   - Implementation of MediaPipe for skeletal tracking
   - Extraction of 33 key body landmarks
   - 3D coordinate normalization

2. **Feature Extraction**
   The system extracts four categories of features:
   - Joint angles (e.g., knee, hip, elbow angles)
   - Velocity and acceleration metrics
   - Postural characteristics (trunk angle, body symmetry)
   - Global shape features (stance width, body height)

3. **Temporal Processing**
   Implementation of a sliding window approach with the following characteristics:
   - Window size: 15 frames
   - Overlap: Configurable based on processing requirements
   - Feature aggregation using statistical measures

#### Data Preprocessing

The `ActionPreprocessor` class implements a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline:

1. **Signal Processing**
   - Smoothing of landmark trajectories
   - Noise reduction in joint angle calculations
   - Normalization of spatial coordinates

2. **Feature Standardization**
   - Z-score normalization of numerical features
   - Robust scaling for outlier handling
   - Consistent feature ordering and organization

### 4. Modeling

#### Model Selection and Training

The training process, implemented in `ActionClassifierTrainer`, follows a systematic approach:

1. **Model Evaluation**
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - XGBoost
   - Hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV
   - Cross-validation with stratified sampling

2. **Training Protocol**
   - Data split: 80% training, 20% testing
   - Stratified sampling to maintain class distribution
   - Validation using 5-fold cross-validation

### 5. Evaluation

Our evaluation strategy encompasses multiple metrics and validation approaches:

1. **Performance Metrics**
   - Overall accuracy
   - Class-specific F1-scores
   - Confusion matrix analysis
   - Real-time processing speed

2. **Robustness Testing**
   - Cross-subject validation
   - Varying lighting conditions
   - Different camera angles
   - Movement speed variations

### 6. Deployment

The deployment phase focuses on real-time implementation through the `RealTimeActionRecognizer` class:

1. **Real-Time Processing Pipeline**
   - Efficient frame processing
   - Feature extraction optimization
   - Memory-efficient sliding window implementation
   - Robust prediction smoothing

2. **User Interface**
   - Real-time visualization of predictions
   - Postural analysis display
   - Performance metrics monitoring
   - User feedback integration

## Quality Assurance

Throughout the methodology, we implement several quality assurance measures:

1. **Data Quality**
   - Automated validation of recorded videos
   - Feature quality checks
   - Landmark detection confidence thresholds

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Continuous FPS monitoring
   - Prediction confidence tracking
   - System resource utilization

3. **Error Handling**
   - Robust exception handling
   - Graceful degradation strategies
   - Automated logging and monitoring

## Conclusion

This methodology represents a comprehensive approach to human action recognition, incorporating best practices from both academic research and practical implementation. The framework is designed to be both robust and flexible, allowing for future improvements and adaptations while maintaining high performance standards in real-time operation.
